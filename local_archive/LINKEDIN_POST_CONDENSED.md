# LinkedIn Post: Stanford Students API - DevOps Journey (Condensed)

🚀 **Just completed an incredible DevOps journey!** Built a production-ready Stanford Students API from scratch to deployment.

## 🎯 **5-Stage DevOps Pipeline:**

**Stage 1: REST API** 🔧
✅ Go + Gin + PostgreSQL CRUD API
✅ 90%+ test coverage + Postman collection
✅ Automated migrations + health checks

**Stage 2: Containerization** 📦
✅ Multi-stage Dockerfile (~15MB distroless)
✅ Security hardened, non-root execution

**Stage 3: Local Development** 🛠️
✅ One-click setup with Make + Docker Compose
✅ Environment isolation + automation

**Stage 4: CI/CD Pipeline** 🔄
✅ GitHub Actions + self-hosted runner
✅ Automated testing, security scanning, Docker push

**Stage 5: Production** 🏭
✅ Load-balanced: 2 API instances + Nginx
✅ Vagrant deployment + health monitoring

## 🏗️ **Architecture:**
```
Nginx LB (8080) → API1 (8081) + API2 (8082) → PostgreSQL (5433)
```

## 📊 **Key Metrics:**
• Image: ~15MB | Startup: <2s | Coverage: 90%+ | Response: <100ms

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack:**
Go 1.21, PostgreSQL, Docker, GitHub Actions, Nginx, Vagrant, Postman

## 💡 **Key Learnings:**
1. Twelve-Factor App methodology is crucial
2. Multi-stage builds dramatically improve security
3. Self-hosted runners provide better control
4. Load balancing ensures production resilience
5. Postman collections enhance developer experience

## 🎯 **What's Next:**
Kubernetes, Prometheus + Grafana, JWT auth, microservices
