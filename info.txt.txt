create an api for stanford university computer science students using Golang and Gin.

Using the API we should be able to perform the following operations:
 - Add a new student.
 - Get all students.
 - Get a student with an ID.
 - Update existing student information.
 - Delete a student record.

 API expectations:
 - Support API versioning (e.g., api/v1/<resource>).
 - Using proper HTTP verbs for different operations.
 - API should emit meaningful logs with appropriate log levels.
 - API should have a /healthcheck endpoint.
 - Unit tests for different endpoints

Other considerations:
 - Exlicitly maintaining dependencies in a file ex (pom.xml, build.gradle, go.mod, requirements.txt, etc).
 - Ability to run DB schema migrations to create the student table.
 - Config (such as database URL) should not be hard-coded in the code and should be passed through environment variables.
 - Postman collection for the APIs.
